### About the Project
This is a volunteer-driven initiative created by a multidisciplinary and multicultural team of designers, developers, and project managers.

The goal of the project is to build a web application that allows users to explore information about <i>Soplo de Vida</i>, a dog shelter based in Argentina. The app will feature details about the shelter, its mission, adoptable dogs, and ways users can get involved or contribute to the cause.
